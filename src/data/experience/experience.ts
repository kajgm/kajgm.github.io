        'In the third year of my computer engineering degree, I opted to deeper into the realm of software development by joining the core infrastructure team at SAP Canda Inc. This Co-Op marked my initiation into handling large-scale code bases and contributing directly to globally recognized products. Throughout this experience, I garnered expertise in diverse areas, such as managing asynchronous webpack dependencies, implementing certificate generation and storage for Go configuration servers, creating automated testing suites using Jest and Jasmine, conducting Jenkins CI/CD analysis, overseeing version bump processes, orchestrating cloud deployments with Kubernetes and Docker, cross-microservice debugging, and so much more. I worked alongside both fellow students and senior engineers to deliver quality code following the agile methodology and concurrently managed the completion of countless Jira tickets. I led code reviews and even full-team meetings to seamlessly integrate improvements into existing workflows and explore new approaches.',

        "During my second year of university, I received an opportunity to join the Systems Engineering Department at Sony Pictures Imageworks. Eager to be part of the immense artistic and technical talent responsible for bringing my favorite movies, like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Lord of the Rings, and Men in Black, to life, I embraced the chance. My tenure at Sony revolved around adapting to a Unix-based environment, where I took on responsibilities involving the maintenance and troubleshooting of the organization's computing infrastructure. Working closely with senior engineers, I contributed to various projects aimed at enhancing both artistic and engineering capabilities. I had the privilege of witnessing multi-million-dollar projects progress through every stage of development, from lighting and texturing to animation and rigging. I even received a film credit for the amazing film: The Sea Beast.",
