      'In the third year of my computer engineering degree, I chose to futher develop my software engineering expertise and joined the core infrastructure team at SAP Canada Inc. This was my first real taste of working on large-scale code bases and contributing to products used around the world. I was immersed in a wide range of challenges, from juggling asynchronous webpack dependencies to building certificate generation and storage for Go-based configuration servers. I also built automated testing suites using Jest and Jasmine, analyzed Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, managed version bumps, orchestrated cloud deployments with Kubernetes and Docker, and even dove into cross-microservice debugging.',
      "I was fortunate to collaborate with both fellow interns and experienced engineers, following agile methodologies and delivering quality code. I tackled countless Jira tickets, led code reviews, and even ran full team meetings to smoothly incorporate enhancements into existing workflows and brainstorm new approaches. This Co-Op was an incredible learning experience, and I'm proud of the impact I made on the team and the products we delivered.",

      "During my second year of university, I received an opportunity to join the Systems Engineering Department at Sony Pictures Imageworks. Eager to be part of the immense artistic and technical talent responsible for media like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Lord of the Rings, or Men in Black, I embraced the chance. My time at Sony revolved around solving various challenges in a Unix-based environment where I took on responsibilities involving the maintenance and troubleshooting of the organization's computing infrastructure. Working closely with senior engineers, I contributed to various projects aimed at enhancing both artistic and technical capabilities. I had the privilege of witnessing multi-million-dollar projects progress through every stage of development, from lighting and texturing to animation and rigging. I even received a film credit for the amazing film: The Sea Beast.",
